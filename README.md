📊 Analyzing the Companies Database 

This time, I explored a fascinating database called companies.db, which contains general information about various companies.

My goal? To analyze when companies were founded, where they are located, their employee counts, and more! 😎

💾 Step 1: Data Cleaning 

Before diving into the analysis, I cleaned the data:

✅ Removed unnecessary columns like domain and location, as they weren’t useful.

✅ Eliminated duplicate records to ensure accurate analysis and visualization.

✅ Handled missing values by dropping rows containing NaN for a cleaner dataset.

✅ Renamed columns for better readability, e.g., industry → Job.

✅ Extracted the founding year from records where the format included extra characters like ..

✅ Converted numerical data to integers to avoid visualization issues.

📊 Step 2: Data Visualization & Insights 1️⃣ Number of Companies per Country 

Using a bar plot, I visualized the number of companies in each country.
